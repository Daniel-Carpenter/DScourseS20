\section{Selector Tool Pull}
The data that I pulled is yearly returns for the S&P 500 market index. Overall, the data that I pulled  \\
does not give much insight, but when dis-aggregating this information, the can be very powerful. \\
Having the ability to pull information might be useful to me, but the process is even more valuable. \\
The real value of information of this is broken out by day, which can be accessed using the rtsdata \\
package in R. \\

I did not use tutorials for this assignment. I referenced Grant's online resource from my fork.

\section{API Pull}
Similar to the previous section, I pulled information relating to stocks; however, I was able to utilize \\
Yahoo Finance's API to pull daily stock data for any security that I input. This information will be \\
useful to me, and is much more valuable than the information that I used with the selector tool. \\
If choose to use financial-security data for my project, having this information will be very useful. \\
Additionally, modeling with this type of pull could be valuable. \\

I used the rtsdata package, which pulls data from financial sources like Yahoo.
